|    >> Firstly, we have already provided a name for this challenge. Please do not alter it. We also ask that you ensure the       |
|       file extension, '.md', remains the same as well.                                                                           |

|    >> Next, you'll find the bare bones and formatting of this file below these instructions. Go wild! We've included some        |
|       Important Notes & Terms to help guide you through the document. These can be found at the end of this section.             |
|                                                                                                                                  |
|    >> Once you're all done, request to commit your changes to our master branch!                                                 |
