![](https://github.com/bonechurch/Route-66/blob/master/images/hello-chicago-IL.png)

## Public Enemy No. 1

The year is 1929. Gangster and bootlegger, Al Capone, and his associates are still at large.
In their efforts to crack down on the leaders of the *Chicago Outfit*, the IRS and Frank J. Wilson have hired you to look into Capone's income, assets and spending. There's one problem though...Big Al's insiders have managed to rig the office's adding machines. Your top secret mission is to **program a new calculator** from scratch.

## Challenge

Your task is to write the classes for a simple calculator application.

## Requirements

* Must include the numbers, 0-9
* Must include the decimal point '.' button
* Must include the constant, PI
* Must include the unary operators: +/- (negation), âˆš, cos(x), sin(x), tan(x), 1/x
* Must include the binary operators: +, -, /, *, y^x (exponentiation)
* Must include an updating diplay
* Must include the = (equals) and CLEAR buttons

## Bonus 

Take your calculator to the next level!

- [ ] Include the LOG, LN, and x! (factorial) buttons...and any other functions you see fit!
- [ ] Implement bracket '()' matching - accounting for the *arithmetic order of operations*
- [ ] Create a display to track your input / output history (upon selection, either can be reused as operands)
- [ ] Transform your standard calculator into a graphing calculator
- [ ] Implement a crafty **LEET SPEAK** converter (ideally, from text to numbers)

##### *(Completed bonus challenges are indicated above)*
