# Gateway Arch, MO

![](https://github.com/bonechurch/Route-66/blob/master/images/gateway-arch-MO.png)

## Cannons & Canoes

*It's the race of the ages!* In a heated exchange along the Mississippi River, the early settlers, Lewis and Clark, are battling out who can reach the Gateway Arch first. Only one may cross the finish line with their cannon-equiped canoe â€” and be crowned Thomas Jefferson's *'Expeditioner of the Century'*! 

## Challenge

Your task is to build a 2-D, HUMAN vs. HUMAN, turn-based *Battleship* game.

## Requirements

##### ***Please refer to the diagram below***

* Must include **2** user-controlled canoes positioned equidistant on either side of the Gateway Arch (finish line)
* Each canoe must be equipped with a cannon that fires projectiles at their enemy
* Each cannon's trajectory must be controlled by the player's *click-and-drag* of their mouse/finger
* A portion of each cannon's trajectory must also be indicated on-screen and respond to the user's mouse/finger movements.
* The trajectories/projectiles must respond to game physics & mechanics
* If the Gateway Arch is struck, the projectile must bounce/respond appropriately
* During their turn, each player must fire their cannon at their enemy
* Must implement HEALTH indicators for each player
* Must also implement a COUNTDOWN timer, for which a player has time to shoot their cannon
* After a round has ended (each player has fired their cannon), both players must advance **1** unit closer to the Gateway Arch
* If a player is struck by a projectile, their canoe should be backtracked **2** units and they should lose a portion of their HEALTH; the player's canoe must not advance at the end of that round
* If a player's HEALTH reduces to **0**, their canoe sinks; and they automatically lose the game
* The player's canoe who reaches the Gateway Arch first, wins the game
* If both players tie the race, the player who has the most HEALTH remaining, wins the game 
* Must implement a gameplay window which: (1) shifts focus between the players' canoes at the start of their turn; (2) focuses on the current projectile being fired.
* Must implement a pause screen with (re)start game functionality

## Bonus

Take your *Battleship* game to the next level!

- [ ] Implement a mini-map to assist players when firing their cannons
- [ ] Include a HUMAN vs. CPU option, and develop the AI appropriately
- [ ] Include online functionality, in which players can compete with opponents from anywhere
- [ ] Make the game more dynamic (and challenging), by allowing the canoes to drift forward continuously
- [ ] Implement the selection of various characters whose cannons & canoes may have different special abilities. Beyond the original *Lewis and Clark*, these additional characters may include: *Bazooka Joe* (projectiles launch farther), *Bouncing Betty* (projectiles bounce on water), *The Flying Dutchman* (canoe drifts faster), *Popeye* (canoe withstands more damage) & more...
- [ ] Release your game to a website or app store (and tag us, so that we can reward you!)
- [ ] For the daring, make your game 3-D!
