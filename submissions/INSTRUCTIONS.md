### Looking to contribute your own challenge solutions?

We can't thank you enough! You are why our community exists!

After you have completed a challenge in any programming language, follow these steps to share your solution:

1. Navigate to the [Submissions](https://github.com/bonechurch/Route-66/tree/master/submissions) directory
2. If none already exists, create a directory with the challenge name (i.e. hello-chicago-IL)
3. Create a sub-directory with the programming language name (i.e. java)
4. Create another sub-directory with your submission name (i.e. yourname-hello-chicago-IL)
5. Append your solution within this final directory
6. Finally, submit your pull request to our master branch

If all goes well, the path to your solution should look something like this:

> *hello-chicago-IL/java/bonechurch-hello-chicago-IL/src*
